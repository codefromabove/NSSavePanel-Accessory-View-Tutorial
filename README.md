# NSSavePanel-Accessory-View-Tutorial

This is a very basic demonstration of how to add an accessory view to an NSSavePanel, using image type selection as an example. The intended audience for this code is a novice Cocoa programmer; experienced programmers can find a very nice NSSavePanel customized for image files here: [JFImageSavePanel](https://github.com/jaz303/JFImageSavePanel).
